# EE202C IoT Systems for Precise Classification of Upper Body Motion 

## Applications 

### i. Precise monitoring of activity<br />
### ii. Monitoring of motion for neurorehabilitation<br />
### iii. Precise guidance of motion skills<br />

## Systems
### i. Includes use of FANN systems for real time detection and guidance<br />
### ii. Includes Multiple IoT devices and 9DOF Sensors and Kits<br />

## Objective
### i. Product Development for advancing Neurorehabilitation monitoring systems of upper body motion<br />

## System Function
### i. Detect and Classify Activity<br />
  1. Rest state<br />
  2. Reading Book<br />
  3. Typing or using mobile device<br />
  4. Operating appliances in kitchen<br />
  5. Others to be defined<br />
### ii. Activity Definition and Pass Fail Criteria<br />
  1. 100 seconds period of sustained activity or proposed period<br />
  2. Deliverable is definition of activity characteristics in terms of time and amplitude.<br />
  3. Deliverable is also a ground truth verification<br />

## System Validation
### i. Demonstrate accuracy by report of confusion matrix<br />
### ii. Demonstrate accuracy across activity types<br />
### iii. Demonstrate accuracy across users<br />
### iv. Include ground truth measurements based on video recording and measurement methods for motion to be developed.<br />
